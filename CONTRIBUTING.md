# Contribution Guidelines

Please feel free to mention projects that are built on Javaslang.

Self-promotion is ok!

However, in rare cases we may need to discuss it after a first look. This will take place directly in the pull request or in an issue. Of cause we may reject entries for any reason.

Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased. 
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

We are really looking forward to your submissions!
